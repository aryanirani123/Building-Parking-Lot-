# Building-Parking-Lot

###### Welcome to the Building Parking Lot project

In this project I have built a website using Google Apps Script,HTML and CSS that allows you to keep track of your building parking lot. 
Lets take an example, if a car of another resident is parked in your parking lot and you want to find whose care it is. You can used this web app to access the database of the residents car's and find out whose car is parked and call the respective resident to remove their car.

This project is built using Google Apps Script, cloud based JavaScript which interacts with Google Workspace Tools. I have used some javascript to access the data present in the Google Sheet and then use HTML and CSS to display them on the website.
